-- -- -- moon-phases -- -- --
This program finds the phase of the moon on the date given to it.
Note that the phase is a bit of an approximation, but should be relatively correct most of the time.

By default the program displays the ASCII art as if it were viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, pass the `--north` flag to the program.
